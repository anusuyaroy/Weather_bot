**Speech Recognizer**
=====================

Description
===========
Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format. Rudimentary speech recognition software has a limited vocabulary of words and phrases, and it may only identify these if they are spoken very clearly. More sophisticated software has the ability to accept natural speech.

Python Code

.. code-block:: python
   

   r = sr.Recognizer()                                                                                   
	with sr.Microphone() as source:                                                                       
   print("Speak:")                                                                                   
   audio = r.listen(source)
